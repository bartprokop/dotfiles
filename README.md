# dotfiles
Finally I decided to have my own dot files...

## First setup

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

### Homebrew

```bash
==> Next steps:
- Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    echo >> /Users/bart/.zprofile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/bart/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
